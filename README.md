# JavaScript Arcade

The goal is to recreate old games in JavaScript for the purpose of learning the language. The rules are:

1. It is okay to look at how others have accomplished similiar games, but you cannot follow tutorials. 
2. Everything has to be written in JavaScript.
3. Have fun! It's okay to change the games a little bit to adapt them to how you want.
